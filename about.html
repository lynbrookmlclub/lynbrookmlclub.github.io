                        Hi! I'm super excited to be your 2018-19 president! I started web dev in 8th grade and have continued learning through online courses and the club. I TAed several years for a web design summer camp and for the past two years, I've been the webmaster for a regional youth volunteering site. I love to make random side projects and share computer history facts, so join us to build cool projects and learn about computers! I hope we can inspire a newfound (and lasting) interest in both the coding and non-coding parts of web dev!

                        Hello! I'm Web Dev's 2017-18 Secretary & Treasurer. I primarily work with JVM languages and also have experience with Linux, Python, and JavaScript. I spent last summer teaching Python, programming robots in Scala, and writing a full-stack Kotlin webapp at a startup. WebDev this year is going to be great as we make all sorts of cool and interesting websites - don’t miss out!

                        Hey there! I'm your Head of Back End, and I've been coding for 4 years. I have experience with some cool technologies like Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, and other really cool stacks (not related to WebDev). I hope to be able to teach you guys some advanced web development tools, and how to create advanced projects with persistent, real-time data.

                        Hi there! I'm the head of front-end, and have been learning coding since 5th grade, starting with web dev.  I have much experience with the standard languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript, and with many of JavaSrcipt's librarires and frameworks such as Vue, JQuery, and Angular. I have built websites for multiple volunteering organizations, for hackathons, and for myself and friends. If you join webdev, you'll learn the skills to do the same! We'll be working on cool projects throughout the year and possibly do some competitions, so make sure you and your friends join!

                        What’s up guys! This year I will be your head of front-end helping to introduce you guys into the amazing world of html and css! I’ve been doing web design since 8th grade but still in the process of learning it to its fullest potential(searching things up on stackOverflow). I love going to hackathons competing and especially socializing with the people. If there’s one thing I cannot stress enough about coding, it’s gotta be having connections with the people around you for the future : ) All that aside, I cannot wait for this year of WebDev to begin!
