                        Hi! I'm super excited to be your 2018-19 president! I started web dev in 8th grade and have continued learning through online courses and the club. I TAed several years for a web design summer camp and for the past two years, I've been the webmaster for a regional youth volunteering site. I love to make random side projects and share computer history facts, so join us to build cool projects and learn about computers! I hope we can inspire a newfound (and lasting) interest in both the coding and non-coding parts of web dev!

                        Hello! I'm your Vice President for 2018/19. I primarily work with JVM languages but also have experience with functional programming, real-time control systems, and server-side web development. This summer, I built a robotics software framework, researched type-systems, and programmed microcontrollers. Currently, I'm managing web development for two organizations. WebDev this year is going to be great. We make all sorts of cool and interesting projects - don’t miss out!

                        Hey there! I'm your Head of Back End, and I've been coding for 4 years. I have experience with some cool technologies like Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, and other really cool stacks (not related to WebDev). I hope to be able to teach you guys some advanced web development tools, and how to create advanced projects with persistent, real-time data.

                        Hi there! I'm the head of front-end, and have been learning coding since 5th grade, starting with web dev.  I have much experience with the standard languages: HTML/CSS/Javascript, and with many of JavaSrcipt's librarires and frameworks such as Vue, JQuery, and Angular. I have built websites for multiple volunteering organizations, for hackathons, and for myself and friends. If you join webdev, you'll learn the skills to do the same! We'll be working on cool projects throughout the year and possibly do some competitions, so make sure you and your friends join!

                        Hello there! I'm your secretary/treasurer for 2018-19 school year. I learned the majority of web dev skills through this club, having minimal exposure to web dev before. I have quite a bit of experience with HTML/CSS and know a little bit about BootStrap as well. I would say I am still in the learning process, having to look up information occasionally. We will be presenting interesting topics and projects, and we want to cater to your interests. Even if you have little experience with coding, you should join web dev!
